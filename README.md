Overview:
The Gameplay Ability System is a framework for handling complex gameplay mechanics, such as character abilities, buffs, debuffs, and more. It provides a flexible and data-driven approach to manage these mechanics.

Key Components:

Abilities: These are the individual actions or effects that can be applied to characters or objects in the game.
Attributes: Attributes represent the numerical values associated with characters or objects, like health points, mana, or damage.
Effects: Effects define the changes or actions that occur when an ability is activated, like dealing damage, healing, or applying status effects.
Gameplay Tags: Tags are used to categorize abilities, characters, and gameplay elements, making it easier to manage interactions.
Ability System Component:
Characters in UE4 have an Ability System Component that handles the activation and management of abilities. This component can be extended to suit your specific gameplay needs.

Abilities and Effects:
Abilities can be created using Blueprint or C++ and can consist of multiple effects. Effects are responsible for modifying attributes, applying damage, and more.

Input Bindings:
Players can trigger abilities through input actions, and the Ability System Component handles the input binding and activation.

Networking:
The Gameplay Ability System is designed with networking in mind, making it suitable for multiplayer games. It handles the replication of abilities and effects seamlessly.

Cooldowns and Costs:
You can set cooldowns and resource costs for abilities, allowing for balance and gameplay control.

Integration with Animation:
The system can integrate with animations to synchronize ability activations with character animations.
